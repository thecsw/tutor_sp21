* Calculus II

** Week 1, Feb 8th
  During the first week, Calculus II students started a quick recap on
  elementary derivatives, integrals, L'HÃ´pital's rule. Followed by Substitution
  Method and Improper Integrals.

** Week 2, Feb 15th
  Second week covered Sequences and Summing an Infinite Series.

  Notes: (no notes to publish)
   
** Week 3, Feb 22nd

** Week 4, March 1st
  Fourth week concentrated on Power Series, Taylor Polynomials, and Taylor
  Series. Fantastic things such as Squeeze Theorem and limit convergence
  theorems!

** Week 5, March 8th
  Week five spent the first days of the week preparing for their first
  midterm. I did some problems to prepare students on topics from Week 1 up to
  Week 4. Midterm I was held on Tuesday, March 9th. Later in the week, the
  class has covered Area Between Two Curves, and Setting Up Integrals.

** Week 6, March 15th
  This week has covered some fun material over Volumes of Revolution, Method of
  Cylindrical Shells, and Work & Energy problems. Do You remember finding volumes
  by rotating functions with defined domain on axis parallel or orthogonal to
  the axis of rotation? Don't forget about Riemann Sums.

** Week 7, March 22nd
  This week covered such fundamental material as Integration by Parts and some
  ways to solve Trigonometric Integrals.

** Week 8, March 29th
  This week went on some Trigonometric Substitution and methods of Partial
  Fraction Decomposition.

** Week 9, April 5th
  This has been an exciting week, where Calculus II learned the art of
  Parametric Equations, finding Arc Lengths, and a different way of thinking
  about space, specifically, applying Polar Coordinates.

** Week 10, April 12th
  The beginning of this week was spent in preparation for Midterm II, which was
  held on April 13th. Later, they just started learning about Vectors.

** Week 11, April 19th
  This week went over Vectors in Three or more Dimensions and Dot
  Product. Exciting!

** Week 12, April 26th
  Last week of tutoring! It's bittersweet to see the semester coming to an end,
  especially the study sessions. We finished with more Vector Material, Cross
  Products, and did some wrap-up problems.
