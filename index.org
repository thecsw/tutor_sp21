** Introduction
Hello there! This is a webpage for some of my notes I took while tutoring in
the Spring of 2021. This notes collection includes worked examples, problems,
worksheet questions for Calculus II, Calculus III, and Physics I.

I took notes while tutoring for KU School of Engineering. The class codes I
tutored are MATH 126, MATH 127, and PHSX 210. The study session started on the
second week of classes, so if the semester's first day was February 1st, study
sessions started on the week of February 8th.

For the sake of simplicity, we start counting weeks not from the first day of
classes, but the first day of study sessions. So each week is followed by the
date of the week's Monday.

I need to say that some notes may be a week behind the material in class. This
is simply because students have a week after a new lecture to write up their
homeworks, quizzes, and take-home assignments. Notes, of course, concentrate
on tackling those problems. Try opening various notes if you're looking for
specific material.

  sessions, here is a description:
